		<td>This block is a basic furnace, that works like furnace from cobblestone. It can be easily crafted on the start, like cobblestone furnace from the game.</td>

## Cincinnasite Forge
This block is more powerful than normal furnace â€” it can process items with X2 speed consuming same amount of fuel.


## Cincinnasite Anvil
This is a simple anvil made from Forged Cincinnasite and Nether Bricks. It can be used as a normal one.


## Nether Brewing Stand
This brewing stand has a bit different craft recipe than normal one, but can process more recipes (for example - extracting water from Barrel Cactus)
