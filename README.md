This is just a clone/fork of https://github.com/paulevsGitch/BetterNether/wiki that I made to test formatting, so don't refer to it!
The links are broken and images are misssing. I'm just a fan of the mod and want to help contribute to the original wiki so it's useful to the players and saves the BetterX team from repeating themselves.
I'm also researching what I can from playing the mod, checking REI, and scouring over the repo. I will probably make mistakes.
After I write up everything I, as a player, would want to be able to look up, I want to pass this back to the BetterX team to check for correctness and hopefully copy into their wiki.
